# Airbnb Clone Project

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive full-stack application that replicates the core functionality of the Airbnb platform. It provides a robust, scalable backend that handles user interactions, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

This project not only develops technical proficiency in backend development, security, and CI/CD but also emphasizes collaboration, planning, and continuous learning within a team environment.

## 🏆 Project Goals

* **User Management**: Implement secure user registration, login, and profile management.
* **Property Management**: Enable creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of property listings.
* **Booking System**: Allow users to make and manage bookings for available properties.
* **Payment Processing**: Integrate a secure payment gateway to handle booking transactions.
* **Review System**: Provide functionality for users to leave and manage reviews and ratings.
* **Data Optimization**: Optimize backend data retrieval using caching and database indexing.

## 🗄️ Database Design

The backend database schema reflects real-world entities with clear relationships:

### 🔹 Users

* `id`: Primary Key
* `username`
* `email`
* `password`
* `is_host`

### 🔹 Properties

* `id`: Primary Key
* `owner_id`: ForeignKey to Users
* `title`
* `location`
* `price_per_night`

### 🔹 Bookings

* `id`: Primary Key
* `user_id`: ForeignKey to Users
* `property_id`: ForeignKey to Properties
* `check_in`
* `check_out`

### 🔹 Payments

* `id`: Primary Key
* `booking_id`: ForeignKey to Bookings
* `amount`
* `payment_date`
* `status`

### 🔹 Reviews

* `id`: Primary Key
* `user_id`: ForeignKey to Users
* `property_id`: ForeignKey to Properties
* `rating`
* `comment`

### 🔗 Relationships

* A user can have many bookings and properties.
* A property can have many reviews and bookings.
* A booking has one payment.

## 🔍 Feature Breakdown

### 1. **User Management**

Secure registration, authentication, and profile management using Django's auth system.

### 2. **Property Management**

Hosts can add, edit, or delete listings with full CRUD functionality.

### 3. **Booking System**

Enables guests to make and manage reservations, with booking conflict resolution.

### 4. **Payment Processing**

Payment system records transaction details and connects them to bookings.

### 5. **Review and Rating System**

Guests can submit feedback and ratings for properties they’ve stayed at.

### 6. **API Documentation**

RESTful endpoints documented using OpenAPI; GraphQL API for dynamic frontend queries.

### 7. **Security Features**

Authentication, authorization, rate-limiting, and data validation to secure user and payment data.

### 8. **CI/CD Integration**

Automated pipelines with Docker and GitHub Actions for testing and deployment.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is critical to the integrity and trustworthiness of the application:

* **Authentication**: JWT or token-based authentication ensures identity verification.
* **Authorization**: Role-based access (e.g., host vs. guest) to protect sensitive operations.
* **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks.
* **Input Validation**: Avoids SQL injection and other input-based exploits.

Security protects sensitive operations such as:

* User account and payment info
* Booking availability
* Property listing data

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD pipeline ensures seamless development, testing, and deployment:

* **CI Tools**: GitHub Actions for unit testing, linting, and integration checks.
* **CD Tools**: Docker for containerized deployment across environments.
* **Benefits**:

  * Early detection of bugs
  * Faster iteration and deployment
  * Reproducible environments
