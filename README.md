The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive full-stack application that replicates the core functionalities of Airbnb. It is designed to simulate real-world software development practices and help learners build scalable, secure, and collaborative web applications. This project enhances backend expertise, database modeling, API development, security implementation, and CI/CD pipeline integration.

üöÄ Project Goals
Simulate a full-scale booking platform similar to Airbnb.

Strengthen full-stack development skills with a focus on backend and database systems.

Master collaborative team workflows and modern DevOps tools.

Embrace secure software design practices and continuous delivery.

üë• Team Roles
Role	Responsibility
Backend Developer	Develop and maintain RESTful APIs, handle business logic, and ensure seamless server-client communication.
Database Administrator (DBA)	Design, optimize, and manage database schemas and ensure data integrity and performance.
DevOps Engineer	Set up CI/CD pipelines, manage deployments, and maintain development environments.
Project Manager	Oversee timelines, team coordination, and ensure the project meets its milestones.
QA Tester	Test APIs and application features to ensure reliability and compliance with requirements.

üõ† Technology Stack
Technology	Purpose
Django	A high-level Python web framework used for building robust backend systems and RESTful APIs.
MySQL	Relational database management system for storing structured data like users, bookings, and reviews.
GraphQL	API query language used to fetch specific data efficiently and flexibly.
Docker	Containerization platform to ensure consistency across development and deployment environments.
GitHub Actions	CI/CD tool for automating testing, linting, and deployment workflows.
Markdown	Used to format documentation in a readable and structured way.

üóÉ Database Design
Entity	Key Fields	Relationships
User	id, username, email, password, role	A user can own multiple properties and make bookings.
Property	id, title, description, location, price	A property belongs to a user and can have multiple bookings and reviews.
Booking	id, user_id, property_id, check_in, check_out	A booking is made by a user for a specific property.
Review	id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment	A review is posted by a user for a property.
Payment	id, booking_id, amount, status, timestamp	A payment is linked to a booking.

‚ú® Feature Breakdown
User Management
Allow users to register, log in, update profiles, and manage authentication securely.

Property Management
Enable hosts to list, update, and delete properties, including images, pricing, and availability.

Booking System
Users can view available properties, make bookings, and manage reservations.

Review System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings after stays to promote trust and feedback.

Payment Processing
Secure payment handling integrated with booking confirmations and history.

üîê API Security
Security Area	Measure	Purpose
Authentication	JWT or session-based login	Verify user identity.
Authorization	Role-based access control	Prevent unauthorized actions (e.g., only hosts can list properties).
Rate Limiting	Throttle excessive requests	Prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
Input Validation	Sanitize user inputs	Prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
HTTPS	Secure communication channel	Protect data in transit.

‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code, ensuring high-quality delivery.

Tool	Use
GitHub Actions	Automate testing, linting, and deployment upon push or pull request.
Docker	Containerize the application for consistency across all environments.
Postman/Newman	Automated API testing in the CI pipeline.

CI/CD ensures faster feedback, reduces manual errors, and maintains deployment consistency.
